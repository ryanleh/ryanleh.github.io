    <h3> This page will walk you through decrypting your BRAND NEW PREMIUM BIRTHDAY LETTER WOW </h3>
	<p> So most of the this stuff will probably be new to you, but just think about it this way...
		I'm not only expressing my appreciation for you in a letter, I am also gifting you KNOWLEDGE
	<br>
	<br>
		WOOT LETS BEGIN
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Download the program + ciphertext by visiting
            <a href="https://ryanleh.github.io/veronica/bday_stuff.zip"> here</a> if you haven't already
        </li>
        <li>Unzip the files to your Desktop</li>
		<li>Open up Terminal (Just search for it)</li>
        <li>Type "cd ~/Desktop" into Terminal --> cd stands for "change directory" and the
            tilda is your home directory.  So basically you're telling the terminal to
            navigate to the Desktop.</li>
        <li>Type "ls" --> ls stands for "list segments" and it lists all the files in
            your current directory.  Somewhere in the listing should be two
            files: 'scrypto' and 'ITSYOBDAY.enc'
        <li>Type "cat ITSYOBDAY.enc" --> This prints out the contents of the
            file ITSYOBDAY.enc!  This is what a ciphertext looks like - just
            seeming randomness</li>
        <li>Type "cat scrypto | wc -l" --> This prints out how many
            lines the file scrypto is.  THAT'S HOW MANY LINES OF CODE I WROTE
            FOR YOUR BDAY (jk it wasn't that many and I also had already made
            this)</li>
        <li>Type "chmod +x scrypto" --> This makes sure you can execute the
            scrypto file (which is used to decrypt the file)</li>
        <li>Type "./scrypto -d ITSYOBDAY.enc" and when prompted type in your
            real name as the password (AKA Veronica duhhhhh) --> This runs
            scrypto in decrypt mode on the file ITSYOBDAY.enc.  If everything
            works correctly you should see "File: ITSYOBDAY.enc decrypted!"</li>
        <li>Type "ls" --> There should be a new file called 'ITSYOBDAY.txt'</li>
        <li>Type "cat ITSYOBDAY.txt" --> print your bday letter!</li>
	<ul>
    <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    Real friends make you work for love :')
    <br>
    <br>
    Also originally I was like "Oh I'll just write her a lil' letter that's
    very platonic" but then this ended up being way longer and more romantic
    then intended LOL (well romantic in my mind at least because honestly if a girl were to make a webpage
    and encrypt a file for me I'd be buying the ring already just sayin) so
    apologies PAL *cough* but I do hope you enjoy :)
