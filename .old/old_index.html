            Hi! I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science and Applied
            Mathematics at US Berkeley as a Regent's and Chancellor's scholar!

	    <div id="about_me">
            I encompass many forms of nerdiness whether they be in math, CS, or music. I
            have many <b>sets</b> of random interests that <b>span</b> many <b>spaces</b>
            (see what I did there).  In particular, I abolsutely love
            playing pickup bball/vball, anything tech/math related, reading
            voraciously, having those deep philosophical discussions with friends,
            and enjoying a delicious cortado.
            <br>

            While I've had many regrettable moments in my life (such as forgetting
            my highschool graduation speech) here are some accomplishments I'm most proud
            of: solving a Rubik's cube in 20 seconds, playing bass with an
            all-black Gospel family band, looking into the eyes of an actual Kiwi
            bird, and singing a solo in the Sydney Opera House.

            I was gonna put some sort of cute picture here but instead enjoy a
            video of me hacking some government stuff
