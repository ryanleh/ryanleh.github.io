        <span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align: middle;">
        Iâ€™m a freshman here at Cal, and encompass many forms of
        nerdiness whether they be in math, CS, or music. I have many
        <b>sets</b> of random interests that <b>span</b> many <b>spaces</b> (see what I did there).  In particular, I abolsutely love
        playing pickup bball/vball, anything tech/math related, reading
        voraciously, having those deep philosophical discussions with friends,
        and enjoying a delicious cortado.

        While I've had many embarassing moments in my life (such as forgetting
        my highschool graduation speech) her are some accomplishments I'm most proud
        of: solving a Rubik's cube in 20 seconds, playing bass with an
        all-black Gospel family band, looking into the eyes of an actual Kiwi
        bird, and singing a solo in the Sydney Opera House.

        I was gonna put some sort of cute picture here but instead enjoy a
        video of me hacking some government stuff
