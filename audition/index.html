          <p style="display:inline-block;width:100%;">
            The most important thing you need to know about being in DeCadence
            is that you will be sure to find a community of talented musicians,
            thoughtful friends, and fun-loving Golden Bears. We are a bunch of
            musical hooligans, but in our free time we like eating good food
            together, jam seshing, watching movies, group studying (go bears),
            and enjoying each other's terrible puns.
            <br><br>
            In DeCadence, we are committed to musical excellence. This involves
            each member being fully engaged during rehearsal, taking time to
            review their music outside of rehearsal, and putting forth their best
            effort as a musician and as an essential part of the group.
            <br><br>
            Events we traditionally perform at include the UC Berkeley Welcome
            Back Showcase, West Coast A Cappella Showcase, and our own DeCadence
            end-of-semester concert. We have often attended the California A
            Cappella Festival at UCLA and have competed at ICCAs (The
            International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella).
            Throughout the year, we perform at birthdays, alumni events, student
            outreach programs, staff parties, the occasional proposal or wedding,
            and whatever else people hire us to do! Wherever we sing, it's always
            a great experience.
            <br><br>
            Come out and sing for us! We can't wait to meet you at auditions.

                have good intonation/pitch, be able to learn a part relatively
                quickly, and be able to carry a part in a group of other people
                singing different parts. We also greatly appreciate the ability to listen
                to musical feedback and adjust your performance accordingly. For those
                new to reading music, we highly recommend taking Music 20A to help you learn
                the basics. Also, if you’re interested in arranging music or vocal percussion, that’s a big plus!

                  note you can go. Just pick something that best showcases your voice
                  and go with it! It would be helpful to choose a song in a
                  comfortable range for your voice that has some dynamic contrast (soft/loud) and
                  doesn’t have too much empty space between lyrics.</td>

                (timing decided by the section members) and our weekly Sproul performance
                on Wednesdays from 11:00-12:30pm (Sproul attendence is more flexible). In
                addition to this, we often have small performances throughout the year and a big
                concert at the end of each semester. Most of our members stay for at least
                a year, and we also hope that auditionees will consider committing
                at least a year in the group.</td>

                on group size for any given semester (the group has been between 10-18
                members historically). Many of our members actually did not get
                into the group on their first or even second audition. That’s why
                we strongly encourage singers who don’t get in to take some music classes
                and/or audition for other groups to build experience, then come back
                and audition again!</td>

                <td>Absolutely! Since the beginning of each semester is new and
                exciting, we understand the importance for students to explore new
                clubs and activities. It is totally acceptable to audition for other
                groups, and some might be a better fit than others. By doing so,
                you’ll gain valuable audition experience in addition to learning more
                about our great a cappella community at Cal. Whether it be for DeCadence or
                others, we want you to find the perfect fit for your a cappella
                interests (but we really hope it’s us)!</td>
